A simple c++/unix prgram to implement ant-style filtering.

I'm going to try and translate this into [go](http://golang.org/).

My reasons are:

1. This is a very simple program.
2. It does file I/O.
3. It needs to be fast and small.  Especially fast in startup.
   (eg. this rules out clojure.)
4. I want to learn go.

I will start by doing this all in the "go" subdirecty.
