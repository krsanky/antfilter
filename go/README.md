These are some messy notes.
I think I cut these from the go distribution's docs.

    hg clone -r release https://go.googlecode.com/hg/ go

$GOBIN
The location where binaries will be installed. The default is $GOROOT/bin

    export GOROOT=$HOME/go
    export GOARCH=386
    export GOOS=linux


To build the Go distribution, run

    $ cd go/src
    $ ./all.bash


## Writing programs:

Given a file file.go, compile it using

    6g file.go

6g is the Go compiler for amd64; it will write the output in file.6. The
6 identifies files for the amd64 architecture. The identifier
letters for 386 and arm are 8 and 5. That is,
if you were compiling for 386, you would use 8g and the output would be
named file.8.

To link the file, use

    6l file.6

and to run it

    ./6.out

A complete example:

    cat >hello.go <<EOF
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
         fmt.Printf("hello, world\n")
    }
    EOF

    6g hello.go
    6l hello.6

    ./6.out
    hello, world


There is no need to list hello.6's package dependencies (in this case,
package fmt) on the 6l command line. The linker learns about them by
reading hello.6.

To build more complicated programs, you will probably want to use a
Makefile. There are examples in places like go/src/cmd/godoc/Makefile and
go/src/pkg/*/Makefile. The document about contributing to the Go project
gives more detail about the process of building and testing Go programs.
